	        	<h2>Hello, World!</h2>
	        	<p>This is the homepage for the <a href="http://d120.org" target="_blank">Mundelein High School</a> programming club. We provide an environment for MHS students to program and learn to program. We're newly founded so there'll be more to see here later. (^Ì®^)</p>
	        	
	        	<h2>Goal for this Club</h2>
	        	<p></p>
	        	<ul>
	        		<li>Give people a chance to learn and program with others</li>
	        	</ul>
	
	        	<h2>Projects we are currently doing or will be doing</h2>
	        	<p></p>
	        	<p>Some things we'll definitely be working on:</p>
	        	<ul>
	        		<li>Chrome extensions. MHS issues chromebooks to students which means these extension can have a big impact. For example, the school CIPA filter blocks a lot of relevant sites. Visiting all these sites to find that they're blocked is annoying and time-wasting, so a chrome extension that lets you know whether a link is blocked is bliss.</li>
	        		<li>Processing sketches. For most new members byte club will be their first time coding and <a href="http://processing.org/">processing</a>/<a href="http://processingjs.org/">processing.js</a> is an ideal way to begin, as it allows you to write visual programs easily and immediately. You can make <a href="http://beesandbombs.tumblr.com/">cool art</a>, <a href="http://raphaelrk.com/pjs?sketch=mandelbrot">interactive demonstrations</a>, and much more!</li> There's also a great curriculum and editor for it at <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/cs/programming">Khanacademy.org</a>
	        		<li>Hackathons. This is when programmers get together and build cool things in a short span of time. Some (unaffiliated) examples of hackathons people could attend are <a href="http://codeday.org/">CodeDay</a> or any of the many listed at <a href="http://mlh.io/">MLH</a></li>
	        	</ul>
	        	<p>Things we have worked on:</p>
	        	<ul>
	        		<li><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/byte-me-submissions/6114950898778112"> Impossible Game Challenge</a> is what we made as a fun club project to put out Khanacademy programming skills to use. The club members made mini-challenges that were put together to make one big game.</li>
